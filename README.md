# RobloxAddSettings

This Java Program Automatically Adds ClientAppSettings Into Roblox.

(This Is Also My First Offical Java Project)

To My Knowledge This Works With Windows Only
I Will Try To Make Separate Versions For Linux And MacOS


# How To Use It:

1. Download The Zip And Extract It.
2. Be Sure You Have The Java Runtime Environment : https://www.java.com/en/download/ (I Will Eventally Make Another Verison Of This In C# or C++).
3. Run The Executable As An Administrator.
4. Now You Can Use Alt + Enter For True Full Screen.
